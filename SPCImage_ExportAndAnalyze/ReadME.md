## SPCImage Export (post-analysis) followed by upload into MATLAB (or Octave)

### The powerpoint 'SPCImageExportAndAnalyze_slideShow' illustrates how one can:
1. Import .sdt files (B&H FLIM data) into [FIJI](https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads) and subsequently export TIFF files containing TPSFs

2. Export SPCImage obtained results in image form.

3. Import SPCImage obtained results into MATLAB (or [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)) for further statistical analysis.
  * The script 'SPCImageOpenAndAnalyze.m' goes through the process using the example data 'NADPH_AU565 2'
