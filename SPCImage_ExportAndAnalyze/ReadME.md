## SPCImage Export (post-analysis) followed by upload into MATLAB (or Octave)

### The powerpoint ['**SPCImageExportAndAnalyze_slideShow**'](https://github.com/jasontsmith2718/DL4FLI/blob/master/SPCImage_ExportAndAnalyze/SPCImageExportAndAnalyze_slideShow.pptm?raw=true) illustrates how one can:
1. Import .sdt files (B&H FLIM data) into [FIJI](https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads) and subsequently export TIFF files containing TPSFs.

2. Export SPCImage obtained results in image form.

3. Import SPCImage obtained results into MATLAB (or [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)) for further statistical analysis.
  * The script ['**SPCImageOpenAndAnalyze.m**'](https://github.com/jasontsmith2718/DL4FLI/blob/master/SPCImage_ExportAndAnalyze/SPCImageOpenAndAnalyze.m) goes through the process using the example data 'NADPH_AU565 2'
