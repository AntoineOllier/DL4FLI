## SPCImage Export (post-analysis) followed by upload into MATLAB (or Octave)

### The powerpoint 'SPCImageExportAndAnalyze_slideShow' illustrates how one can:
1. Import .sdt files (B&H FLIM data) into FIJI and subsequently export TIFF files containing TPSFs

2. Export SPCImage obtained results in image form.

3. Import SPCImage obtained results into MATLAB (or Octave) for further statistical analysis.
  * The script 'SPCImageOpenAndAnalyze.m' goes through the process using the example data 'NADPH_AU565 2'
