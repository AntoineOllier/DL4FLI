## Modeling fluorescence lifetime propogation through turbid media via [Monte-Carlo eXtreme](http://mcx.space/) (MCX)

#### _**Importance notice**_: 
This is an ongoing project and has not been heavily validated. Any work using this simulation routine by the authors will be included here once available.

### **Requirements:**
1) MATLAB
2) [**MCX 2019**](http://mcx.space/)
  * For those interested, MCX workshop 2019 provides helpful exercises [here](http://mcx.space/#mcx19)
